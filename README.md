# Tinder_Bot

## What ? 
Quick project I did for fun. Its a bot that login in tinder and like everybody automatically. I used [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) for the automation process.
I also made a small GUI with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tkinter.html)

## How ? 
The user enters their Tinder credentials (email adress and password). The inputs are retrieved in the ENTRY widget and are sent to the automation function when the user presses the "submit" button.
The bot will then connect to Tinder.com, encode the credentials, log in and start swiping. 

## Layout

The layout of the interface is very rudimentary and would still require some work.
